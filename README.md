# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 12, 2025**

## Overview

This application ("NearLink") is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. All communication occurs directly between devices without requiring internet connectivity or central servers. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it with another user through a direct peer-to-peer connection.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What Data We Collect

The application collects and stores the following information locally on your device:

- **User Profile Information**: Nickname, optional profile picture, and device identifiers
- **Chat Messages**: All messages sent and received, including text content and timestamps
- **Chat Metadata**: Chat histories, participant lists, and conversation settings
- **Connection History**: Records of nearby devices discovered and connection requests
- **Security Credentials**: Encrypted passcodes and authentication tokens for device security

### How Data is Stored

All data is stored **locally on your device** using:

- **SQLite Database**: Encrypted local database for structured data storage
- **Secure Storage**: Platform-specific secure storage mechanisms for sensitive information (passcodes, authentication tokens)
- **Local File System**: Media files and attachments stored in app-specific directories

**Important**: No data is transmitted to or stored on external servers, cloud services, or third-party infrastructure.

## Communication Technology

### Peer-to-Peer Connectivity

The application uses the following technologies for direct device-to-device communication:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: For device discovery and initial pairing
- **Multipeer Connectivity Framework** (Apple devices): For high-speed local network communication
- **Wi-Fi Direct** (when available): For enhanced data transfer speeds

All connections are:
- **Direct**: Device-to-device without intermediary servers
- **Local**: Limited to devices within physical proximity
- **Encrypted**: End-to-end encryption for all message content

### No Internet Required

This application operates entirely offline and does not require:
- Internet connectivity
- Cellular data
- Wi-Fi infrastructure
- Cloud services
- Central authentication servers

## Data Security

### Encryption

- **At Rest**: All sensitive data stored on your device is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms
- **In Transit**: All messages transmitted between devices use end-to-end encryption
- **Passcode Protection**: Optional device-level passcode protection with secure hashing

### Authentication

- Device pairing requires mutual consent from both parties
- Connection requests can be accepted or declined
- No third-party authentication or identity verification

## Data Sharing

### User Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Explicit Consent**: Data is only shared when you initiate a chat or accept a connection request
- **Selective Sharing**: You choose which messages to send and with whom
- **Revocable Access**: You can delete conversations and remove connections at any time

### What is Shared

When you connect with another user:
- Your nickname (as configured in your profile)
- Messages you explicitly send
- Optional: Profile picture (if set)

### What is NOT Shared

- Conversations with other users
- Your location or GPS coordinates
- Device information beyond what's necessary for connectivity
- Any data from other applications on your device

## Data Retention

### Local Storage Duration

- **Messages**: Stored indefinitely on your device until manually deleted
- **Chat History**: Retained locally until you delete individual chats or clear all data
- **Archived Chats**: Remain in archive until permanently deleted

### Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time:

- **Individual Messages**: Delete specific messages from conversations
- **Entire Chats**: Delete complete conversation threads
- **Application Data**: Uninstalling the application removes all locally stored data
- **Account Reset**: Clear all data through the app settings

**Note**: Deleting data on your device does not affect copies on other users' devices.

## Permissions

### Required Permissions

The application requires the following device permissions:

- **Bluetooth**: To discover nearby devices and establish connections
- **Local Network** (Apple devices): To enable Multipeer Connectivity
- **Storage**: To save messages and media files locally
- **Notifications**: To alert you of new messages (optional)

### Permission Usage

- Permissions are only used for their stated purpose
- No permission data is shared with third parties
- You can revoke permissions through your device settings (this may limit functionality)

## Third-Party Services

This application **does not use**:

- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Cloud storage providers
- Social media integrations
- Third-party authentication services
- Crash reporting tools

## Children's Privacy

This application does not collect any information from users. Since all data remains local to the device and no internet connectivity is required, there is no age-based restriction on usage. However, parental guidance is recommended for minors using communication applications.

## Data Portability

Your data is stored in standard formats on your device:

- **SQLite Database**: Industry-standard database format
- **Local Files**: Standard file formats for media and attachments

You can access your data through:
- Device backup mechanisms (platform specific cloud Backup)
- Export features within the application (if available)

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Cross-Platform Devices

- Data stored in app-specific sandbox
- Multipeer Connectivity used for local communication
- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct used for communication
- Data included in device backups (unless disabled)


### Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Devices on different platforms can communicate with each other
- All platforms use the same encryption standards
- Data format is consistent across platforms

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:

- Changes in applicable laws or regulations
- Updates to application features
- Improvements to security measures

Changes will be communicated through:
- Updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this document
- In-app notifications (if significant changes occur)

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: View all data stored by the application on your device
- **Deletion**: Delete any or all data at any time
- **Portability**: Export your data through device backup mechanisms
- **Control**: Manage all permissions and privacy settings

## Contact

Since this application operates without central servers or developer-controlled infrastructure, there is no data collection or processing by the developer. All data handling occurs locally on your device under your direct control.

For questions about this Privacy Policy or the application's privacy practices:

- Review the application's open-source code (if available)
- Consult the user documentation
- Contact through the developer's official channels (if provided)

## Compliance

This application is designed to comply with privacy regulations including:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation): No personal data processing by controllers/processors
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act): No sale or sharing of personal information
- **COPPA** (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act): No collection of children's information
- **Other Jurisdictions**: Local-only data storage ensures compliance with most privacy laws

## Security Considerations

While we implement strong security measures, please be aware:

- **Device Security**: Your device's physical security is your responsibility
- **Backup Security**: Device backups may contain unencrypted application data
- **Recipient Trust**: Messages sent to other users are under their control
- **Network Security**: Use secure Wi-Fi networks when available for enhanced security

## Disclaimer

This application provides privacy through its architectural design (local storage, peer-to-peer communication). However:

- No system is completely secure
- Physical device access can compromise data
- Recipients of messages control their copies
- Device backups may be accessible through cloud services

## Acknowledgment

By using this application, you acknowledge that:

- You understand this Privacy Policy
- You accept the privacy practices described herein
- You are responsible for maintaining your device security
- You understand that offline communication has inherent limitations
